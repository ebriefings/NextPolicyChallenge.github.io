GitHub Tutrial
===============

##Objective

Most Git and GitHub tutorials you’ll find online start with the premise that people want to - or more accurately, the presenter thinks you should - understand the principles and mechanics of version control and what Git is. This tutorial skips all that and assumes that you **just want to get working with GitHub** with as [little difficulty as possible](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/11/github-for-everyone#awesm=~ow4yO7gECJf7fI), and that you **only want to work with text documents** once you’re there - not work with computer code. (A deeper question is [why GitHub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfUnRir6n7BTfx_GLYzPLF7gazrdsrcfpdBT6NHnmbk/edit?usp=sharing)? I’m not going to argue that GitHub is the way to do text collaboration, or even a good way. In fact, this tutorial is part of a [project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10X6SWQatKTMnrWU7riVB2Mz_887eZvYH0NXFISmNTE4/edit?usp=sharing) that will investigate in part whether GitHub is useful for large scale text collaboration and to observe how people use it). 

Though you can easily find someone who disagrees with this approach, I believe that - if all you were wanting to do is to learn how to drive - it does not help you right now for me to open up the hood and show you how to check the oil. If, after you have learned how to drive, you want to learn about how a car works, then you will have the context of being able to drive to apply to the mechanisms and principles of how the car works. But our focus today is learning how to get started using GitHub. Once you are collaborating with other people on text documents in GitHub, you can then pull back the layers of the parfait and dig more deeply into working with Git from the command line, understanding the principles of distributed version control and exploring the many facets of GitHub.

##Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. signed up for a GitHub.com account and set up your account,
2. created your first project (called a repo or repository) on GitHub.com,
3. installed and configured Git and GitHub for desktop on you Mac or Windows computer,
4. cloned a repo from GitHub.com account to your desktop installation,
5. made changes and saved that repo,
6. synced your online GitHub.com account with the installation on your computer,
7. “forked a repo” (that’s what it’s called - “fork a repo”. Go ahead, say it: it’s fun) from someone else on GitHub.com,
8. submitted that changed repo to the original owner of the file as a suggested modification (this is called “issue a pull request”),
9. invited a collaborator to help you,
10. received pull requests from other people,
11. merged that pull request into a repo you control, and 
12. created your own GitHub page.
